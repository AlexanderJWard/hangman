## Project Overview
Hangman is a classic game that's instantly recognizable and the rules are easy enough for players of all ages to play and enjoy. The goal of the game is to uncover the hidden word by guessing letters or words to reveal new information. If a guessed letter is in the word then it's position in the word is revealed. However, if a letter is incorrect a part is added to the hangman image. Once the person is fully added to the image it's game over!

## Data Model/ Classes


### Class X
To better group the game as an object, I wrote a class representing its properties and had method functions to update those properties: 

**Properties**
- property 1: is a {string} it represents {something} 
- property 2: is a {string} it represents {something} 

**Methods**
- **\_\_init\_\_**: Initialize method, it starts the class off with default parameters as if a user just started to play a game.
- **\_\_str\_\_**: Returns a string representation of the class/object

List out the python libraries you purposefully used in your project and why. You can look at your requirements.txt file and go back to https://pypi.org/ to rediscover the purpose of a library if needed.

A bulleted list is a good presentation for this information.
